[00:12.16] We don't go way back
[00:14.50] Sail before the wind and luck
[00:17.57] Pull shadow away as it's getting longer
[00:23.63] Ain't no home
[00:24.70] Ain't no joke
[00:26.37] So we can stomp hard each day
[00:29.05] The sun is coming up
[00:30.72] We'll be forever
[00:35.00] We're gonna live forever
[00:47.00] 
[01:03.65] Hey, この終わらないバトル勝つ
[01:06.31] 俺の敵にエネルギー使うの無駄
[01:09.17] If you a friend 俺のアンチを守るな
[01:11.51] I wonder 正気最後まで俺が保つか？
[01:22.01] 
[01:13.86] 受け入れは別に
[01:16.48] どうでもいい
[01:16.99] そいつらのためにもう
[01:18.78] やってないから let it be
[01:20.30] I'm gonna leave a legacy
[01:21.73] I know that I am レベチ
[01:23.11] Assumption, people have about me
[01:24.61] Never was 俺の責任
[01:31.61] 
[01:25.78] Apartments to apartments
[01:28.40] Countries to countries never felt I belonged in
[01:31.45] Yeah, If home is where the heart is
[01:34.15] I guess that makes me fucking heartless
[01:53.65] 
[01:37.15] I grew up, moving places
[01:38.65] Every month, lofts and basements
[01:40.08] It was tough, understatement
[01:41.42] Had to run, but I'm shameless
[01:42.92] 移動が止まらず
[01:44.33] 何となく永遠
[01:45.78] So don't ask where I'm from
[01:47.03] I'll tell you where I'll stay next
[02:04.03] 
[01:49.20] We don't go way back
[01:51.72] Sail before the wind and luck
[01:54.63] Pull shadow away as it's getting longer
[02:00.78] Ain't no home
[02:01.87] Ain't no joke
[02:03.55] So we can stomp it hard each day
[02:06.19] The sun is coming up
[02:07.83] We'll be forever
[02:15.83] 
[02:11.87] Weeping and Wailing
[02:13.97] They are crossing the street
[02:16.75] Here is round of applause
[02:20.03] We're suppressed by the chain
[02:22.55] Lassitude and confusion
[02:25.44] They are smiling kind at me
[02:28.21] Time takes a lot of cigarettes
[02:31.46] The smoke-filled dream
[02:42.46] 
[02:33.97] Let it loose
[02:35.41] Hey Oh Hey
[02:39.58] Let it loose
[02:41.45] Hey Oh Hey
[02:45.21] Let it loose
[02:46.83] Hey Oh Hey
[02:50.81] Let it loose
[02:52.57] Hey Oh Hey
[02:56.69] Let it loose
[03:02.69] 
[02:58.29] I'm a legal alien
[02:59.69] And no matter how long I stay
[03:01.12] It will never feel like I've truly been anywhere
[03:04.03] I have many stories to share
[03:05.78] All these dreams I have to give
[03:07.25] Why do some make it out to be a sin？
[03:25.25] 
[03:09.14] It's like I'm treading through the desert
[03:10.70] Without a drop to my name
[03:11.99] Not a cloud in the sky but they snicker in my face and assure me
[03:13.92] That it's gonna rain
[03:23.92] 
[03:15.08] Any minute now
[03:15.95] So come on tell me how
[03:17.22] That I still gotta dig through this burning drought yet again？
[03:48.22] 
[03:20.51] Little brown girl remember who you were
[03:22.32] Before this cruel world tried to snatch away
[03:24.39] Every ounce of your innocence
[03:26.37] Look back and make lessons from the experience
[03:28.65] In this fight you have every right to choose
[03:30.64] Who's in your corner sis
[03:42.64] 
[03:31.91] I give my all and they would say that it still ain't enough
[03:34.85] Work twice as hard for half of what he got good fucking luck
[03:37.60] But I keep on pushing cause that's all I know and how to do
[03:40.58] The Gods know my Mothers had to play by harsher rules
[04:07.08] 
[03:43.26] Weeping and Wailing
[03:45.38] They are crossing the street
[03:48.24] Here is round of applause
[03:51.48] We're suppressed by the chain
[03:53.92] Lassitude and confusion
[03:56.85] They are smiling kind at me
[03:59.66] Time takes a lot of cigarettes
[04:02.91] The smoke-filled dream
[04:13.91] 
[04:05.35] Screaming Weeping and Wailing
[04:08.25] They are crossing the street
[04:11.13] Here is round of applause
[04:14.38] We're suppressed by the chain
[04:16.84] Lassitude and confusion
[04:19.79] They are smiling kind at me
[04:22.52] Time takes a lot of cigarettes
[04:25.74] The smoke-filled dream
[04:36.74] 
[04:28.28] Let it loose
[04:29.65] Hey Oh Hey
[04:33.73] Let it loose
[04:35.34] Hey Oh Hey
[04:39.58] Let it loose
[04:41.15] Hey Oh Hey
[04:45.35] Let it loose
[04:46.87] Hey Oh Hey
[04:51.87] 
[04:52.12] We don't go way back
[04:54.61] Sail before the wind and luck
[04:57.51] Pull memory away as it's getting longer
[05:03.64] Pull back regret and hate
[05:06.46] Pretend to be like a best friend
[05:08.92] The sun is coming up
[05:10.82] We'll be forever
[05:15.03] We're gonna live forever
